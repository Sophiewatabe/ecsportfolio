<h2>People that inspired me to write</h2>
<p>There is no way I could have ever had the courage to start writing without those that have come before me. There are so many infuential female authors that were over looked during their time that are now considered literary genius
   s. It is my goal to one day be like them and follow in their footsteps. My novels may not be published now but once they are I feel I would have completed my goal whether my writing are recieved negatively or postively.
