            <h1> ALL ABOUT ME </h1>
            <p> My name is Soph Watabe and I am currently attending skyline as a 16 year old junior. I am fairly new to this school as sadly I used to attend Olympus. Last year was my first year here and I could not have possibly had a better experience. Being an Eagle has changed me for the better and made me into the person I am today. I am so lucky and privelaged to go to a school as good as Skyline. Between my school work I also balance a part time job and sports team. I have been working at the Sports mall in Murray since I was 14 continuing that job still now in the present time. As for sports I am an avid softball player who is commited to improving my skills. Maintaining all three is difficult but I am improving every day. 
               Skyline is by far superior!!!
